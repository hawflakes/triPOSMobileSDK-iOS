///
/// \section overview Overview
///
/// The Worldpay triPOS® Mobile SDK Framework is designed to allow iOS applications rapid integration for EMV support, point-of-interaction device support, and the Worldpay Integrated Payments Express platform. While the framework has been certified for EMV and to the Express platform, the application to which it is being integrated must also complete testing with Worldpay Integrated Payments and the Express platform to ensure all necessary fields are populated with the correct data and receipts are generated with the required information.
///
/// \section requirements Requirements
///
/// \subsection requirementsAppleMFi Apple MFi Program
///
/// For each manufacturer whose accessory is supported in the application, that manufacturer must add the application to their MFi PPID (Made for iOS product plan ID). Without this, the App Store submission will be rejected. In other words, for each accessory protocol used (see @ref projectSettingsExternalAccessories), the application must be added to that manufacturers MFi PPID.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE: MFi PPID's only apply to 30-pin/Lightning or Bluetooth connected accessories. It does not apply to audio jack, TCP/IP, nor Bluetooth Low Power connected accessories.</strong>
